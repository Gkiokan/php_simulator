<h1>PHP Simulator </h1>

Hey developers out there :)
I thought about a little enviroment how to test some quick written PHP Code.
It will be executed thought the localhost, due the direct executation of the file itself.

It's basicly serialize the Data and post it thought Ajax and return the result in the DIV.
This allows you to make quick tests for PHP Snippets.
